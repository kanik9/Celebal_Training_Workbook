    "1. Defination : Decorators are very powerful and useful tool in Python since it allows programmers to modify the                   behavior of function or class. Decorators allow us to wrap another function in order to extend the                 behavior of wrapped function, without permanently modifying it.\n",

    "                                                                            \n",
    "        - Points : \n",
    "            1. A decorator is a callable that returns a callable function.\n",
    "            2. The decorator acts as a wrapper.The nature of the object that got decorated (actual gift inside)                  does not alter. \n",
    "            3. We can use the @ symbol along with the name of the decorator function and place it above the                      definition of the function to be decorated\n",

    "                * Analytics, logging, and instrumentation : Especially with large applications, we often need to                                       specifically measure what’s going on, and record metrics that quantify                                             different activities. By encapsulating such noteworthy events in their own                                         function or method, a decorator can handle this requirement very readably and                                     easily.\n",

For                                       all its benefits, this means some bugs can try to creep in, which more                                             statically typed languages (like Java) would catch at compile time. Looking                                       beyond even that, you may want to enforce more sophisticated, custom checks on                                     data going in or out. Decorators can let you easily handle all of this, and                                       apply it to many functions at once.\n",

    "    Functional Addons : The first and foremost reason to write a decorator is its flexibility to add extra                                functionality to the defined blocks of code(functions and classes).\n",
    "\n",
    "    Data Sanitization : With proper data sanitization methods, you can remove or destroy the data that is stored                           on memory and make it impossible to recover it. For example, you may use the facility of                           cache to avoid running the same function or you may use methods to validate the user login                         credentials and so on, which points to the importance of data sanitization. A decorator                           can properly sanitize the arguments that passed to the decorated function and also                                 sanitize the data returned from the function.\n",

    "    Function Registration : Another point to write a decorator is to register a function. Here decorator allows                               two or more subsystems to communicate without having much information about each                                   other."

    "1. Defination : Python too supports file handling and allows users to handle files i.e., to read and write files,                 along with many other file handling options, to operate on files. The concept of file handling has                 stretched over various other languages, but the implementation is either complicated or lengthy,                   but alike other concepts of Python, this concept here is also easy and short. Python treats file                   differently as text or binary and this is important. Each line of code includes a sequence of                     characters and they form text file. Each line of a file is terminated with a special character,                   called the EOL or End of Line characters like comma {,} or newline character. It ends the current                 line and tells the interpreter a new one has begun. Let’s start with Reading and Writing files.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Working of open() function : We use open () function in Python to open a file in read or write mode. As                                        explained above, open ( ) will return a file object. To return a file object we                                    use open() function along with two arguments, that accepts file name and the                                      mode, whether to read or write. So, the syntax being: open(filename, mode).                                        There are three kinds of mode, that Python provides and how files can be                                          opened:\n",

    "                                  *  “ r “, for reading.\n",
    "                                  *  “ w “, for writing.\n",
    "                                  *  “ a “, for appending.\n",
    "                                  *  “ r+ “, for both reading and writing\n",
    "                                  \n",
    "    - Working of read() mode : There is more than one way to read a file in Python. If you need to extract a                                      string that contains all characters in the file then we can use file.read().\n",
