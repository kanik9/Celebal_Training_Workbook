It was designed with an emphasis on code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express their concepts in fewer lines of code.\n",

    "    Memory Consumption : Python is not a good choice for memory intensive tasks. Due to the flexibility of                                  the data-types, Python's memory consumption is also high.But it provide 'Garbage                                  Collection'.

As compared to the popular technologies like                         JDBC and ODBC, the Python's database access layer is found to be bit underdeveloped and                           primitive .However, it cannot be applied in the enterprises that need smooth interaction of                       complex legacy data .\n",

    "    Runtime Errors : Python programmers cited several issues with the design of the language. Because the language                      is dynamically typed , it requires more testing and has errors that only show up at runtime .\n",
